                <p>
                    Golden Seas is a real time strategy game where you play as a pirate lord commanding your
                    fleets to attack and plunder the Royal Navy and her cities.  The game was made with a team 
                    of two designers, one 3D artist, one UI artist, and myself as the sole programmer.
                    It won the award for technical acheivement as well as being runner up for best in show in 
                    the <a href="https://gamedev.msu.edu/student-game-showcase/">2019 Student Showcase Event</a>
                    at MSU.

                    <br><br><strong>Positives</strong><br>
                    The game has a robust world generation toolset for the designers to create maps with, 
                    as well as easy customization to all ships and cities. Teamwork and collaboration on the idea
                    of how the final product should look went well.  Everybody helped with roles other than 
                    their primary one.

                    <br><br><strong>Negatives</strong><br>
                    We ran out of time to flesh out and improve the AI, so it is incredibly rudimentary, 
                    exploitable, and unbalanced.
                    Tutorial is a long wall of text, not interactable.  Further work on the game would require
                    creating a viable tutorial.

                    <br><br><strong>What I learned</strong><br>
                    Structuring classes planning for class inheritence ahead of time. Implementing designer 
                    wishes for visuals and functionality of UI.  Realtime mesh generation.  XML serialization.
                    Custom binary save files.
