            I've been playing games and making new ones for decades.  Growing up I always liked combining 
            board games together to make new ones before I eventually stumbled into making games both for 
            a living and for fun.<br><br>
            I graduated from Michigan State University's Games and Interactive Media program, with a minor 
            in Game Design.  I was on the board for the game development club, ran a Global Game Jam Site, 
            and of course played plenty of games alongside my studying and creating them.<br><br>
            I've had fun making games of varying complexity and genres from classes, and a decent spread 
            from work I've had during school and post graduation.  From an artistic bead game, to minigames 
            and a city builder game for an international cognitive study, to winning the Audience Choice 
            Award at PAX East 2022 on an arcade brawler, I've enjoyed my work and all that it's let me do.<br><br>
            By far the biggest project I've been a part of has been Plunder Panic.  Working with 11 other 
            people, we released for nine platforms with online cross-play between all of them.  The most 
            fun thing I've ever done in my life was PAX East when we took the game there and had a 4v4 booth 
            setup, myself personally teaching 1,300 people to play over the four days while pitching, selling, 
            and promoting the game.  The cherry on top being the game winning the award for the show.  It 
            was by far the highlight of my career so far, and I'm hoping to one up it many more times in 
            the future.  Absolutely worth catching Covid at the event.<br><br>
            Games still stick to me outside of work: personal projects like getting mad at floating point 
            for not counting high enough, running different Dungeons and Dragons campaigns with groups of 
            friends, and board games whenever I can with friends.<br><br>
            Obviously I play plenty of video games myself, some of my favorites are Sayonara Wild Hearts, 
            Deep Rock Galactic, and Rimworld.  And my current favorite board games are Gaia Project, Spirit 
            Island, and Wingspan.<br><br>
            Whenever it's time to go outside, I love playing tennis, volleyball, bike riding, and hiking.
