            Hi, I'm a programmer who makes games.  I've been studying at Michigan State University for 4 years and
            am graduating Spring 2021.  Here you can find various games I've worked on, and blog posts about smaller 
            projects I've worked on over the years.

                Golden Seas is a real time strategy game where you play as a pirate lord commanding your
                fleets to attack and plunder the Royal Navy and her cities.  The game was made with a team 
                of two designers, one 3D artist, one UI artist, and myself as the sole programmer.
                It won the award for technical acheivement as well as being runner up for best in show in 
                the <a href="https://gamedev.msu.edu/student-game-showcase/">2019 Student Showcase Event</a>
                at MSU.

                <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Positives</strong></div>
                The game has a robust world generation toolset for the designers to create maps with, 
                as well as easy customization to all ships and cities. Teamwork and collaboration on the idea
                of how the final product should look went well.  Everybody helped with roles other than 
                their primary one.

                The AI is not properly fleshed out at the moment and could use some beefing up, it is currently 
                exploitable and unbalanced.
                Tutorial is a long wall of text, not interactable.  Further work on the game would require
                creating a viable tutorial.

                Welcome Detective, an incident most horrible has occurred in the land of the dead.  
                Lord Marrow has been horrifically revived! Such unspeakable horror can only be the 
                work of white magic, and it is up to you to figure out who committed such an atrocious crime.<br>
                Revival at Marrow Mansion is a game jam game I made along with artist 
                <a href="https://digipaw2.wixsite.com/rhianperry">Rhian Perry</a>, I created an 
                interface to create dialogue trees in the Unity Editor to create the dialogue in the point 
                and click game.  The dialogue editor was a massive undertaking and proved to have quite a 
                few hard to track down bugs, I have since made a superior, node based dialogue editor that 
                I'm still refining to this day.  The dialogue was all written by myself as well.  The map 
                for navigation was incredible to make as well, only 7 lines of code manages a multi location,
                background changing based on hovering map system.  The game's story is unfinished, but it 
                was a fantastic amount of work for the 48 hours I had.

                <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Positives</strong></div>
                Creating a dialogue engine that could be used for other projects in the short time span was a
                fantastic experience that eventually led to me updating it as a <a href="blog.html">standalone project</a>.
                The system to click on things in game was fast and easy to expand, allowing lots of hidden jokes to 
                be littered throughout the game.

                <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Future Upgrades</strong></div>
                A better dialogue system could be implemented (see <a href="blog.html">this blog post</a>) so that there isn't the
                occassional blank line when entering a dialogue tree split.  Actually finishing the story and adding a 
                progression system to the game, one that would allow dialogue to become available after learning certain 
                clues.

                <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>What I learned</strong></div>
                Custom tool creation that would get used across all of my future projects.  Mastered scriptable objects
                in Unity and continue to use them to this day where they are helpful.  Communicating with an artist for specific
                assets, specifically the map, helped me understand the art pipeline more.

                The Perfect Run is a puzzle game where failing has no downside.  Whenever you hit an obstacle you 
                leave a burn in time which you can jump back to whenever you want rather than take damage or lose 
                the level, keeping all positive progress you made and undoing any negatives.  If you reach the goal
                of a level while still having burns remaining, AKA your starting line isn't your ending line, you
                then get to go back through and connect your lines, healing the burns, and perfecting the run.  
                Every level in the end will have a single, perfect, unbroken line from start to finish.  See how
                much you can improve your times through intentional burns and warping, and see how much you can 
                improve the final length of your line by shortening it.  Enjoy a low stakes, no pressure journey
                through 40 levels of particle filled wonderland.

                I created a game myself!  This entire project is a laundry list of things I learned while making.  From proper
                use of static scripts, to rudimentary saving, through deploying a game to the internet.  Optimizing for lower
                end hardware was really successful in the end since the game has a plethora of particle effects at all times.

                <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Future Upgrades</strong></div>
                More levels and online leaderboards for times would make the game much more interesting.  
                Literally any marketing would help as well.

                <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>What I learned</strong></div>
                The entire process of development from planning, prototyping, playtesting, and publishing.  Through two weeks of
                getting the movement to feel how I wanted it to.  The importance of making it functional before making it pretty
                really shined on this project.  Level design was an interesting thing to tackle, and could use some revisiting in 
                the future.
