       and developing stories for friends.  These are some of the things I've made, and I should probably throw up 
       a few other notable ones as well.  Currently making solo projects while job hunting.

          Golden Seas is a real time strategy game where you play as a pirate lord commanding your
          fleets to attack and plunder the Royal Navy and her cities.  The game was made with a team 
          of two designers, one 3D artist, one UI artist, and myself as the sole programmer.
          It won the award for technical acheivement as well as being runner up for best in show in 
          the <a href="https://gamedev.msu.edu/student-game-showcase/">2019 Student Showcase Event</a>
          at MSU.

          <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Positives</strong></div>
          The game has a robust world generation toolset for the designers to create maps with, 
          as well as easy customization to all ships and cities. Teamwork and collaboration on the idea
          of how the final product should look went well.  Everybody helped with roles other than 
          their primary one.

          The AI is not properly fleshed out at the moment and could use some beefing up, it is currently 
          exploitable and unbalanced.
          Tutorial is a long wall of text, not interactable.  Further work on the game would require
          creating a viable tutorial.

          Welcome Detective, an incident most horrible has occurred in the land of the dead.  
          Lord Marrow has been horrifically revived! Such unspeakable horror can only be the 
          work of white magic, and it is up to you to figure out who committed such an atrocious crime.<br>

          Revival at Marrow Mansion is a game jam game I made along with artist 
          <a href="https://digipaw2.wixsite.com/rhianperry" target="_blank">Rhian Perry</a>, I created an 
          interface to create dialogue trees in the Unity Editor to create the dialogue in the point 
          and click game.  The dialogue editor was a massive undertaking and proved to have quite a 
          few hard to track down bugs, I have since made a superior, node based dialogue editor that 
          I'm still refining to this day.  The dialogue was all written by myself as well.  The map 
          for navigation was incredible to make as well, only 7 lines of code manages a multi location,
          background changing based on hovering map system.  The game's story is unfinished, but it 
          was a fantastic amount of work for the 48 hours I had.

          <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Positives</strong></div>
          Creating a dialogue engine that could be used for other projects in the short time span was a
          fantastic experience that eventually led to me updating it as a standalone project.
          The system to click on things in game was fast and easy to expand, allowing lots of hidden jokes to 
          be littered throughout the game.

          <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Future Upgrades</strong></div>
          A better dialogue system could be implemented so that there isn't the
          occassional blank line when entering a dialogue tree split.  Actually finishing the story and adding a 
          progression system to the game, one that would allow dialogue to become available after learning certain 
          clues.

          <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>What I learned</strong></div>
          Custom tool creation that would get used across all of my future projects.  Mastered scriptable objects
          in Unity and continue to use them to this day where they are helpful.  Communicating with an artist for specific
          assets, specifically the map, helped me understand the art pipeline more.

          The Perfect Run is a puzzle game where failing has no downside.  Whenever you hit an obstacle you 
          leave a burn in time which you can jump back to whenever you want rather than take damage or lose 
          the level, keeping all positive progress you made and undoing any negatives.  If you reach the goal
          of a level while still having burns remaining, AKA your starting line isn't your ending line, you
          then get to go back through and connect your lines, healing the burns, and perfecting the run.  
          Every level in the end will have a single, perfect, unbroken line from start to finish.  See how
          much you can improve your times through intentional burns and warping, and see how much you can 
          improve the final length of your line by shortening it.  Enjoy a low stakes, no pressure journey
          through 40 levels of particle filled wonderland.

          <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Positives</strong></div>
          I created a game myself!  This entire project is a laundry list of things I learned while making.  From proper
          use of static scripts, to rudimentary saving, through deploying a game to the internet.  Optimizing for lower
          end hardware was really successful in the end since the game has a plethora of particle effects at all times.

          <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Future Upgrades</strong></div>
          More levels and online leaderboards for times would make the game much more interesting.  
          Literally any marketing would help as well.

          <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>What I learned</strong></div>
          The entire process of development from planning, prototyping, playtesting, and publishing.  Through two weeks of
          getting the movement to feel how I wanted it to.  The importance of making it functional before making it pretty
          really shined on this project.  Level design was an interesting thing to tackle, and could use some revisiting in 
          the future.

        Star Strikers is a 3D multiplayer dogfighter where you play with up to 3 others in 2v2 combat.  
        Fly around with full degree of motion as you shoot down your friends while trying to stay alive yourself.
        The multiplayer is possible thank to Photon.Pun, so working on this has involved learning a new codebase 
        and deterministic workflows.  My work has been on hit registration and gameplay loops over the network, 
        making sure that damage is counted and kills given.  The little things that we all take for granted in the 
        games we play until they stop working.  Was my first online multiplayer game I worked on, and was my final 
        project I worked on at University.  The game was made with industry oversight from Bungie to help us create 
        a better product for our final work as students.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Positives</strong></div>
        Created an online multiplayer game!  Also got to work through the pains of being entirely remote for
         the project.  Ended up being a fun if short experience to play with friends.  Working out all the 
         debugging issues with networking and going down the entire rabbit hole of online gaming was super inciteful.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Future Upgrades</strong></div>
        The game could definitely use better systems outside of the gameplay loop for playing with others.  
        Something that isn't peer to peer would also help make the game be stable enough for more than four players.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>What I learned</strong></div>
        Online multiplayer and all the pains that come with it.  Hit registration, aggressor's favor, 
        and so many issues I see in AAA games make so much sense now and it was good to try to address 
        them and implement/come up with solutions.

        Plunder Panic is a swashbuckling action-arcade game for up to 12 players.  Fight on teams of up 
        to six players in online or local play to become the superior pirate crew.<br><br>
        I started working on the project in July 2021, joining the team to program the User Interface (UI) 
        and cloud save data.  I creating all of our UI scripts and systems that continue to be used today, 
        for both online deterministic UI and local UI.  After this, tackling the cloud data using Playfab 
        and implementing full stat tracking throughout the entire game, learning Photon Quantum to do so.  
        I continued to add new features for the first half a year to flesh out game systems.<br><br>At that 
        point we released into early access on Steam, and the console porting went into full swing.  I 
        was in charge of Technical Requirement Checklists (TRC) on all platforms, becoming the go to 
        person for greenlighting features once they met compliance.  I was personally in charge of making
         the modifications for PlayStation consoles, every console required a plethora of work due to the 
         mixed online and offline nature of our game, while supporting full cross-play between all consoles.<br><br>
        Throughout the development process, we took the game to multiple conferences, at all of which I was in 
        charge of the booth and enticing people in to play the game, during PAX East 2022 alone I taught over 
        1,300 people how to play our game personally during my booth shifts, collecting feedback and converting 
        attendees into customers and fans.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Positives</strong></div>
        I have experience working with and publishing on all consoles now.  Working with the same team and 
        codebase for over a year has also proven that it was worth spending extra time making robust systems 
        to be expanded upon in the beginning, as I've been able to build another year's worth of development 
        on top of my initial UI scripts without needing to rewrite or refactor them.  

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Future Upgrades</strong></div>
        We're continuing to work on the game still, adding new items, maps, and game modes.  We're still 
        pushing to flesh out the active player base to sustain the matchmaking queues better outside of our 
        gathering times when players get on to queue up.  Marketing has been a struggle, we show very well 
        at in person events, but online traction has been slippery at best.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>What I learned</strong></div>
        Console porting and all the challenges that come with meeting each platforms technical requirements, 
        many of which are incompatible with other platforms requirements.  I also learned about making Elo 
        and matchmaking systems for our ranked queue, along with leaderboards for a variety of stats, which 
        is something I've been wanting to learn for a while.

        Blastball: All-Stars is a local multiplayer action sports game that lets you play through a variety of sports
        with your friends.<br><br>This game started production after Plunder Panic was finished, and was the first professional
        project where I was lead programmer and led a team of three junior programmers.  It started out more like a top
        down Lethal League, but iteration and following the fun led us to our variety sport game.  Leading junior developers
        was a fun and good experience, and I enjoy teaching others so this naturally flowed together.  Many of our UI 
        scripts were able to be taken from Plunder Panic and reused as well, which was confidence inspiring after the time
        that had been originally put in to make sure the scripts would work in other solutions.<br><br>The art styles
        have continued to be fluid and evolve as time has progressed, each iteration has been better than the previous
        as we approach the release of the game.  I definitely learned a hard lesson about being willing to give 
        criticism to coworkers when needed, while it isn't fun, it needs to be done at times.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Positives</strong></div>
        A very fun game for all ages.  Playtesters old and young both enjoy it.  Learned to lead a team of developers
        in a professional setting.  Was able to reuse lots of scripts that I have made in the past, and wrote even more
        that will continue to be used in the future.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Future Upgrades</strong></div>
        Fleshing out juice and a more intuitive tutorial are the largest upgrades in my court.  There is a potential 
        to update the game to be online multiplayer as well, but the scope of that is too high for our current funding.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>What I learned</strong></div>
        I relearned linear algebra for this project.  I hadn't touched it since college and this entire game
        was a neat return to 3D math and vector multiplication.  I also learned some basics of ShaderGraph, although
        I have a long way to go before I'd consider myself proficient with it.

        A game breaking puzzle game that exceeds the limits of a normal game.  I worked on this as a side project while 
        making Blastball: All-Stars and Incremantal.  It's simple in both concept and execution, but it was a lot of 
        fun coming up with different puzzles.  Both the cliche ones and the unique ones.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Positives</strong></div>
        Working on this was incredibly easy because of how modular each level was.  Whenever I had an idea for a new 
        level, it could be made and simply added in.  This was also a fantastic game to implement playtester ideas for
        levels, which made the solo project still collaborative.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Future Upgrades</strong></div>
        If I ever come up with enough level ideas I'll make another.  But I am quite happy with how this turned out.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>What I learned</strong></div>
        I learned how to work with Windows DLL's, as well as how to do some niche file system tricks.  The part of
        making the game that involved the most learning was the artwork for the store and library pages.  The game
        itself was mostly lots of simple things utilized in clever ways.

        I enjoy playing incremental and idle games but wanted to do something new.  Every game I've ever played counts
        in base 10, which is natural, because that's what we all count in.  So I decided to make a game where you instead
        upgrade what base you count in, and purchase additional digits to write your number in as well.  This provides
        a dynamic cap to how many resources you can have, and is a unique take on a game genre that can sometimes be samey.
        <br><br>The game eventually got a narrative and skin of creating life, and I was able to take real life 
        biological mechanisms to use as unlocks and gates for the player to pass.  It's fun having a game that actually
        teaches you some things while you play it, and I enjoyed all the research that went into it as well.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Positives</strong></div>
        This was a good incremental to work on UI juice before the one I care more about comes out.  I'll definitely use 
        parts of this in other games I make, and it was nice being able to pull scripts from other games to help make 
        this one faster.  It made good, slow progress as a side project for four months before I made it the primary thing I 
        was working on for the final two months, where it rocketed along to a solid, finished product.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>Future Upgrades</strong></div>
        I still struggle with deciding how to do audio, and with artwork in my solo projects.  I was smart enough to 
        recognize that I can use others help and used asset bundles for the planets and stars.  The only major feature 
        I haven't implemented yet that I want to is animations for the Extinction Events.  Whether it's a volcano, ice age,
        or alien abduction, I think adding some animations in for that would be fun and funny for my players.

        <br><br><div class="center-text"><strong>What I learned</strong></div>
        A lot about biology, but mostly optimization.  Unlike my other incremental game I'm working on, this one inherently 
        struggles with performance due to counting in non-standard bases and the additional math that is needed to constantly 
        rewrite and display massive numbers in increasing complicated ways.
