            Node Based Dialogue Editor
        </h2>
        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
                After making my rudimentary dialogue editor, I knew I could do better and make something significantly more user
                friendly than this:
            </p>
            <div class="blog-image"><img class="zoom" alt="What the dialogue used to look like" src="blog_images/old-dialogue.PNG"></div>
            <p>
                The entire system for creating dialogues here relied on adding new segments all over the place and hooking them 
                together through integer indexes that they had, various checkboxes, and a healthy serving of trial and error.
                The entire dialogue tried to flow from top to bottom between option and dialogue sets, but you could only next
                dialogue inside of options once, so you couldn't really get a full tree setup going, only the shattered remains
                of a tree with manual pointers as for where to go next.  This led to empty dialogues when you tried to leave a 
                nested dialogue to jump to an external option set.  It was also hard to read visually, it was cluttered, difficult
                to understand, and generally unlikeable.  It also had a large backend log of scriptable objects it created.  While
                it did ultimately create one scriptable object you could place into a reader script I wrote, that single scriptable
                object was often just a guide to referencing other scriptable objects in a mess.  Making it difficult to backtrack
                to mistakes in dialogue that you wrote.  The entire reader script is virtually incomprehendable to the modern reader,
                I think the only person who ever knew what was happening with it was myself back when I wrote it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This system was not sustainable or expandable, and I would never want to use it on another project after this one.
                In light of this, I decided to try to create a visual, node based dialogue editor as a personal project.  The goals
                of the updated version are to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make the tool easier to look at</li>
                <li>Make it easier to insert new lines in the middle</li>
                <li>Make reading the output file easier</li>
                <li>Condense the output to be only one file</li>
                <li>Make it easier to change the path of the dialogue branching</li>
                <li>Have a built in way to set exit flags</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>The Result</strong><br>                
            </p>
            <div class="blog-image"><img class="zoom" alt="What the dialogue looks like now" src="blog_images/new-dialogue.PNG"></div>
            <p>
                With a brand new look we have a wonderful new editor!!!  You can click and drag to move around the entire tree, 
                drag individual nodes around, click the tabs on either side of the nodes to connect them up, and resize each tab 
                using the button in the bottom right.  The output file is now completely inclusive, no extranuous clutter is made
                elsewhere in the project.  You can easily set the name in the green entry node, and set exit flags in the red exit
                nodes. Nodes can only exit to one location but multiple inputs are allowed for looping dialogue.  Adding new paths
                mid tree is now only a right click -> add node away.  Loading and saving is easy, and with everything in window 
                resizable it fits in any space you want to work with.  
            </p>   
            <p>
                <strong>Future Additions</strong><br>                
            </p> 
            <p>
                I plan on adding the ability to duplicate nodes later on, which would create a unconnected node that has the same 
                contents, the ability to connect generic variables to the nodes allowing animations, voice lines, portraits, and 
                more to be easily stored and set.  This would make it easy to integrate this into any existing dialogue setup. 
                This would also include writing a generic reader which I have not currently done, although this has been tested out 
                in a small game some friends made (no link unfortunately).  The ability to highlight multiple nodes to move them all
                at once would be a nice quality of life improvement to make in the future, as well as being able to completely 
                customize the path the the connection lines make so that they don't overlap with anything you don't want them to.
